# Personal-Projects

Hey there, welcome to my repository! This is where I store all my data science projects as I navigate my undergrad studies. It's like a journal of my journey, constantly updating as I learn new things and work with different datasets I find online.

I'm particularly interested in trading and the financial sector, so you'll find many related projects here. From analyzing stock market data to predicting market trends, I'm exploring the fascinating world of finance through a data science lens. I'm always open to feedback and suggestions as I explore this dynamic intersection of data and finance, one project at a time.
